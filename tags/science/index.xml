The bulwark of the dated and confusing Imperial system actually signed the treaty in ~1880 which metric countries signed to agree on the metric system. The United States &lt;em>intended&lt;/em> on converting to the metric system. Instead we have a beautiful system where all of our units are metric units and a conversion factor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the complexity of the Imperial system in all of its glory yet, check out this wikipedia image.

&lt;p>I found this by stumbling on an old youtube video by Veratasium which is linked &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmSJXC6_qQ8">here&lt;/a>
Pretty neat!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Super-generations exist</title><link>https://jackchampagne.com/posts/2020-04-30-monarch-cycles/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jackchampagne.com/posts/2020-04-30-monarch-cycles/</guid><description>&lt;p>Did you know&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>that every 4th generation of monarch butterflies, specifically the generation the flies from the southern United States to their winter migration spot in Mexico live 10x longer than the three generations that came before them?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the first episode of a documentary series I watched today by National Geographic called &lt;em>Great Migrations&lt;/em>, Nat. Geo. explored the Monarch butterflies migration patterns. The migration cycle is a year long cycler that spans 4 generations of butterflies. Every 6-8 weeks, monarchs lay their eggs hundreds of miles southward of where they were born and begin a new generation. On the last leg of their journey, monarchs give rise to one more generation coined a &amp;lsquo;super-generation&amp;rsquo; that lives 10x longer (~6-7 months long) who then makes the long journey into the center of Mexico. They live mostly sedentary lives here until the cycle begins again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lightning strikes the earth a lot more than you think</title><link>https://jackchampagne.com/posts/2020-04-29-lightning-rate/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jackchampagne.com/posts/2020-04-29-lightning-rate/</guid><description>&lt;p>Did you know&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>that lightning strikes occur on earth at ~44 times per second?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was reminded of this little tibit when I was watching a nature documentary, &lt;em>Night on Earth&lt;/em> last night on netflix. I finished the last episode yesterday there was a shot of elephants with a lightning show in the background. It was beautiful and it reminded me of when I learned of this statistic years ago reading one of my books. I didn&amp;rsquo;t remember the number but quickly found 44 (± 5) strikes per second on the wikipedia page for lightning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>There's a large hexagon on Saturn</title><link>https://jackchampagne.com/posts/2020-04-26-saturns-pole/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jackchampagne.com/posts/2020-04-26-saturns-pole/</guid><description>&lt;p>Did you know&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That at Saturn&amp;rsquo;s north pole, there is a large hexagonal shaped atmospheric feature?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neither did I, but apparently it has been around for decades and as of right now, scientists have not reached consensus
on an explantion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Galactic Dinosaurs</title><link>https://jackchampagne.com/posts/2020-04-25-galactic-dinosaurs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jackchampagne.com/posts/2020-04-25-galactic-dinosaurs/</guid><description>&lt;p>Did you know&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last time the solar system was at this point in The Milky Way, dinosaurs were still roaming the earth?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t either, but an article in &lt;strong>Scientific American&lt;/strong> showed me how we are trying to map our Milky Way,
why its so hard, and what we&amp;rsquo;ve discerned so far. The Solar System orbits the Milky Way &lt;em>~6 times&lt;/em> faster than
the earth orbits that sun! (in linear velocity))&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lions eat cheetahs</title><link>https://jackchampagne.com/posts/2020-04-23-lions-diet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jackchampagne.com/posts/2020-04-23-lions-diet/</guid><description>&lt;p>Did you know? &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That lions will hunt cheetahs and eat them?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Me neither, but today I watched an episode from a documentary on netflix called &lt;strong>Night on Earth&lt;/strong> that
showed me a group of cheetahs and how a lion threatens the cheetahs nightly hunt. Also of note, cheetahs
and lions have excellent night vision.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>We used to have better teeth</title><link>https://jackchampagne.com/posts/2020-04-22-fossil-teeth/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jackchampagne.com/posts/2020-04-22-fossil-teeth/</guid><description>&lt;p>Did you know? &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That teeth found from humans that lived 10,000 years ago have been found to have less gum disease,
fewer cavities, less overcrowding and generally &lt;em>straighter&lt;/em> teeth?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yeah, me neither, but a Scientific American article enlightened me today on how and possibly why that
is the case.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
