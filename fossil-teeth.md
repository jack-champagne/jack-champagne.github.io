title: We used to have better teeth

Did you know? ...

That teeth found from humans that lived 10,000 years ago have been found to have less gum disease, 
fewer cavities, less overcrowding and generally *straighter* teeth?

Yeah, me neither, but a Scientific American article enlightened me today on how and possibly why that
is the case.
