Last night, after 4.5 hours of watching movies yesterday me and my girlfriend Lillian finished *The Hobbit* movie trilogy. The precursor to the *Lord of the Rings* series by J. R. R. Tolkien. I have to say a few things about the series so far. For one, I was surprised to see the middle movie *Desolation of Smaug* have signifigantly lower (only slightly) ratings than the other two movies overall. After watching the movie it made a lot of sense to my as to why. If I had to watch that movie in movie theaters and the next movie *Battle of Five Armies* hadn't come out yet, I would have been deeply frustrated with the ending. The movie finished off on a cliff-hanger that was far too-intense for my liking. I enjoy having movies leave some to be desired so it doesn't feel too conclusive but having a dragon (Smaug) moments away from descending down on a town and causing death and destruction and then ending the movie was a bit of a cop out in my opinion. Since I was watching these movies after all of them have been released, that frustration wasn't there and actually was something I found to be a positive. The previous movie, of course, now led in perfectly to the final movie, picking up right where we left off.

Today, I am getting some work done for AirCycler and am taking the day for myself. So far it has been quite slow and my recent Youtube ban has been a little bit of a failure. I am learning though! From my failures that is. I defeated Reddit two years ago now and am looking at implementing a better system for myself. I believe that less of the time-sucker apps and content in my life will contribute to a bigger feeling of fulfillment, better sleep, better mental health, and better motivation. Overall this will free up my time for other activities that I also enjoy but will be more informative, interesting, and fulfilling. I would like to read the book *Automate the Boring stuff* by Al Sweigart. I find it could be very useful in the future for me, getting rid of the monotonous tasks that I will envitably have to do. I would also like to read the textbook *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* by Steven H. Strogatz which so far has been very interesting and enlightening. (Those challenge problems are pretty hard!)

Till next time,
Jack
