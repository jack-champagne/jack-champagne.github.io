This past weekend was my birthday weekend and I got home from staying at my moms on the 13th. When we were up there we did a tremendous amount of yardwork. When I got home, my grandmother was down to visit. I learned how to make her incredible Kahlua cheesecake and spent time with her catching up. My dad announced on the 13th or the 14th that getting a dog this fall is almost certain. On the 14th, I got a terrible sunburn when me and my girlfriend went out to Saquish to look for moon snails and have a bit of a picnic.

On my birthday I recieved two gifts that I am looking forward to using. The first is an apple watch, which I am wearing right now. The second is a Kindle, which I would like to use to read in bed at night instead of my phone screen. Hopefully the display is not backlit like a normal lcd display and the tablet is suitable for nighttime reading. I also recieved new shoes from my mom which I have wanted badly these past couple of weeks.

As I get older, a birthday just feels like another normal day. If I was asked by someone how old I am, I'd probably respond with 18 accidentally still. This is the reality but fortunately I have not gotten to the point where I say an age from two years ago. I have found some difficulty and trouble trying to motivate to do work. The tasks that I have set out at AirCycler seem very doable and are broken up into bite size chunks but I find the work to be less interesting than that which I decide to do for my own personal improvement.

Some things I wanted to jot down for some note taking:

* I started the cryptography and micro/macro economics course on Khan Academy earlier this summer. And have not been doing that recently. (At one point I found myself needing pen and paper to organize my thoughts for the cryptography and econ quizzes, which made it more difficult to do before bed and such)
* I also have many other books I would like to read and ~~a Scientific American magazine~~ to get through as well. (10 python books to read)
* ~~I also want to note that my python script for sending me text from my computer does not work now for unknown reasons. I am unable to connect to gmail's smtp server.~~
* ~~I have not watched youtube in weeks... I'm not sure how long it has been but life has felt more fulfilling, busy, and peaceful recently. I feel like I am taking care of the people around me better and sometimes I feel like I am taking care of myself better (although this morning I lay in bed for nearly an hour, a habit that I am going to start to break)~~
* I want to start reading my next python book on my kindle
* I want to clean the garage
* ~~I want to put a roof on the Green's Harbor trailhead sign (for my Eagle Scout project)~~
* I want to get enough sleep and exercise every day! (Can track these things now using my apple watch)
* I want to work 20 hours a week consistently and put away 25% of everything that I make.
* I want to get more nighttime photography (Was about to last night but instead wrote a summary of campus' plans to repopulate to my friends)
* ~~I want to clean my room again, there is too much on the walls~~
* ~~I want to set up a little stand at the base of my bed for a projector setup~~
* ~~I want to write more of these posts. (Am wondering right now if having this private information exposed is a privacy concern of mine.)~~
* ~~I want to create a comprehensive todo list focused around my health~~
* I want to clean out the garage
* I want to set up an r-pi cluster compute server
* I want to get my part 107
* ~~I want to play more minecraft with my girlfriend~~
* ~~I want to spend more time on discord calls with friend and in-person risk-mitigated hangouts~~
* I want to spend more time around Lillian's family to connect more 
* I want to program guis in flutter to try it out
* ~~I want to learn options and market information through  Cboe and others~~
* I want to play guitar more
* I want to automate more of my life
* ~~I want to plan out Dyken pond trips with my friends this summer.~~
* I want to bike more.
* ~~I want to go to bed earlier and get more sleep.~~
* I want to have more time? Make more time
* ~~I want to camp and go on more hikes~~
* I want to *clean* my mom's car
* I want to see moon snails
* I want to start my web programming course again on khan academy
* I want to continue my python code-academy course (or find a different service)
* I want to continue learning c and c++

( 6-25-2020 )

* I want to give myself more time
* I want to be the best that I can be.
* ~~I want to get right out of bed and wake up earlier (8am)~~

I want a lot of things in life. And it always seems like there's just not enought time. One small thing at a time though, and I know it will get done. I know it will.

This could have a ton of tags but because of the nature of this list, I think I am going to keep it with only these.

Till next time,
\- Jack
