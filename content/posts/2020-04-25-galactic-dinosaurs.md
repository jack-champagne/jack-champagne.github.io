Did you know...

The last time the solar system was at this point in The Milky Way, dinosaurs were still roaming the earth?

I didn't either, but an article in **Scientific American** showed me how we are trying to map our Milky Way,
why its so hard, and what we've discerned so far. The Solar System orbits the Milky Way *~6 times* faster than
the earth orbits that sun! (in linear velocity))
