I am going to be honest, last week was such a blur. On monday, I got home after a weekend with my mom and now its already Saturday afternoon. A lot of this has to do with how I've been spending my time, the workload at the end of the week due to exams, and also taking care of my family's puppy Ivy.

I have two ideas of things that I want to do programming wise:
1. Continue working on the youtube bot.
2. Create a minecraft package manager (??)

I would love to keep my minecraft configurations up to date effortlessly. Litematica is very cool and useful.

I'm not sure what I should write here today but I am sure I will have more stuff to write about after this weekend.
