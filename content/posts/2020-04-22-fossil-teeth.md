Did you know? ...

That teeth found from humans that lived 10,000 years ago have been found to have less gum disease, 
fewer cavities, less overcrowding and generally *straighter* teeth?

Yeah, me neither, but a Scientific American article enlightened me today on how and possibly why that
is the case.
