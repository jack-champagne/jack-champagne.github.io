Yesterday, or rather, earlier this night. My girlfriend and I beat the Enderdragon in the game *Minecraft*. She died twice and I did not die once. I went through all 7 of my golden apples, my 2 regeneration potions, my 3 slow falling potions, and 64 arrows. It was hard work getting to this point but this is *the first time I have done it completely legit, no commands*. We immediately got an end city, got one elytra, and then another end city and another elytra. Earlier that same day, I finished 3 classes of mine for Spring Semester at UMass Amherst.

A list of the classes I have taken and are taking can be found elsewhere on my website. Maybe on my projects page!
As of writing, these files still haven't been made into a webpage. Hoping after tomorrow's computer science final project that I will have the time to fully devote to understanding ruby gems, jekyll, liquid, and more html, css, and javascript stuff.

#### Some goals of mine that have been achieved
~~1. Excel in your classes for your freshman year.~~
~~2. Make some really great friends that are interested in what you're interested~~
~~3. Learn more~~

#### Some goals for the summer
1. Get Bubbles up and running with a GUI
2. Stay in touch with friends all over
3. Learn even more

Talk soon,
Jack
