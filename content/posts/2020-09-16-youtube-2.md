Today marks the first day of actual development on the youtube downloader version 2. For this version, I plan on adding a few useful features and changing the underlying workings and dependencies. Here are some ideas:
- Make dependencies lightweight by looking at dependency source code
- Remove shelve and replace by json file reading and writing

Feature additions:
- Download playlist
- Single video downloader

Possible additions:
- Channel name search?
- Continuous integration?

For one, I don't think shelve is necessary for saving simple strings of urls. The multithreading is very nice in the previous version and I am very proud of it. I would like to organize this by making issues and refactoring the code so that it is more readable.
