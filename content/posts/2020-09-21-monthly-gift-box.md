A simple subscription to a monthly gift box service that is specialized in sending chocolates, love, and female hygiene products right on time every month.

Got a girlfriend that is 1000x happier after eating chocolates during hell week? This gift box will have all the dark chocolate she needs, and other customizable items too. (A card, plushie, funny photo, even hygiene products)

Is there a market space for this? Hopefully, or else chivalry is completely dead. This is my theory.
