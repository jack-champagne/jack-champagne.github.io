Maps of China are broken

No seriously, pick any city in China and zoom into it. It looks fine at first, especially when only on the default map view. But if you choose satellite view, you'll notice some weird stuff pretty fast. You'll notice roads going over oceans and streets not aligning with satellite imagery. You'll notice businesses that seem out of place. Basically satellite view and street view don't align.

This is because to be able to do surveys of China, you need permission from the Chinese government. The only company(ies?) that have surveying permissions of China are Chinese companies. So, the satellite imagery you see of China is correct, but all of roads, business locations, and land borders are all messed up because google is not authorized to use actual mapping data of Chinese land. I think the original video I saw on this topic was a video from *Half as Interesting* [Here's the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Di-UVC-_4)
