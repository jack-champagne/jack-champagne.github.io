Did you know? ...

That lions will hunt cheetahs and eat them?

Me neither, but today I watched an episode from a documentary on netflix called **Night on Earth** that
showed me a group of cheetahs and how a lion threatens the cheetahs nightly hunt. Also of note, cheetahs
and lions have excellent night vision.
