Did you know...

that lightning strikes occur on earth at ~44 times per second?

I was reminded of this little tibit when I was watching a nature documentary, *Night on Earth* last night on netflix. I finished the last episode yesterday there was a shot of elephants with a lightning show in the background. It was beautiful and it reminded me of when I learned of this statistic years ago reading one of my books. I didn't remember the number but quickly found 44 (Â± 5) strikes per second on the wikipedia page for lightning.
