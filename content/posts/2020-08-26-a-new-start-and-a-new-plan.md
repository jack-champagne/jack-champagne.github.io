It's over. I have decided the youtube does not contribute anything tangible (in the way I use it) to my life. I am fed up and frustrated by how dangerous and how easily I fall into its trap and I am done with it. This morning, I woke up late for class because I should have went to bed earlier. It is nothing but a time waster.

Here is my plan. I need to start valuing my time more. I am going to put my current hourly value at minimum wage ($12.75/hr). Every hour wasted per day on youtube (and other time wasting excessive behaviours) I must transfer those funds to my Titan holdings and the money will not be able to be spent.

To help enforce this, I am going to start try and write a firefox extension that can track my youtube usage.

This may be the start of something new, something better, and possibly a lot less spending money. Hopefully I can hold myself to it.
